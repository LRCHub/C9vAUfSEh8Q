Maybe your eyes will [unverified]
And your teary tears will make it alright
Maybe home is a thought, not a place
Where you can move and still be safe

Only I know in another time
I can feel its edges and it's fine
I want to steal from you, only you
Make room for it

I am the thief who leaves it behind
The moon and the window
I am the thief who leaves it behind
The moon and the window
So good

So is your home a thought, not a place?
You can move, you're still safe
Maybe your eyes are a satellite
And your teary tears will make it alright

Only I know in another time
I can feel these edges and it's fine
I want to steal from you, only you
Make room for you

I am the thief who leaves it behind
The moon and the window
I am the thief who leaves it behind
The moon and the window

If you see yourself through the eyes of another
Maybe you will be alone forever
If you know yourself through the face of another
Maybe you would know a warmth forever

If you see yourself through the eyes of another
Maybe you will feel at will forever
If you know yourself through the face of another
Maybe you would know a warmth forever

If you see yourself through the eyes of another
Maybe you will feel alone forever
If you feel yourself through the face of another
Maybe you would know a warmth forever
